### Info

Quasicraft is a minecraft server where we try to use all technical minecraft development to design and build as efficient and good-looking farms as possible.

### Players

<img src = "img/players/huwoujoli.png" alt = "player-face" width = "16px"/> huwoujoli (main builder)

### Mods

We use a number of mods to enhance gameplay for ourselves such as:
- [fabric-carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet)
- [carpet-extra](https://github.com/gnembon/carpet-extra)
- [lithium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric)
- [servux](https://github.com/maruohon/servux)
- [syncmatica](https://github.com/End-Tech/syncmatica)

We also use a bunch of client side mods, check them out [here]()

### Rules

**Duping:**
- We dupe sand, because it isn't renewable
- We dupe elytras through region file deletion and general item duping to minimize world size

**Carpet Rules:**
- `commandPlayer` Spawn local players without alts
- `commandProfile` See game performance
- `ctrlQCraftingFix` Lets us use ctrl Q with crafting
- `accurateBlockPlacement` makes tweakeroos accurateBlockPlacement usable

**Game Rules**
- `doFireTick false` This is so builds can't burn down when lighting strikes or something gets lit on fire
- `playersSleepingPercentage 0` Just one player sleep in a vanilla gamerule

**Datapacks**
- An edited version of [VanillaTweaks'](https://vanillatweaks.net/) track statistics, with support to see playtime in hours, minecart distance in km and playtime in days
- [Fallen_Breath's](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/DiggyScoreboard) Diggy scoreboard to see the total digs of players
- [VanillaTweaks'](https://vanillatweaks.net/) anti enderman grief, because it's really annoying in builds and the world in general

### World
We try to make a beatiful, heavily technical oriented world with a lot of farms. We try to keep chunk generation minimal and we make lots of perimeters for every farm. The world runs on a private server and uses `7746693467270` as seed.
